## 📝 Intro

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables developers to build scalable, optimized web applications with features like static generation, server-side rendering, and API routes out of the box.

---

## 🚀 The Benefits of Next.js

- **SEO-friendly**: Pre-rendering of pages for better search engine indexing.
- **Performance**: Optimized for faster page loading and seamless user experience.
- **File-based Routing**: No need for a complicated routing setup, it's intuitive and easy.
- **Fullstack Capabilities**: Allows backend logic with API routes, handling data fetching seamlessly.

---

## 🗂️ File & Folder Structure

Next.js has a file-based routing system. Here are some common folders and files you'll encounter:

- `pages/` - Contains all routes of the application.
- `app/` - New folder structure for app directory (available in Next.js 13+).
- `public/` - For static assets (e.g., images, fonts).
- `components/` - For reusable React components.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Server & Client Components

- **Server Components**: Run only on the server, useful for data fetching or sensitive logic.
- **Client Components**: Run on the client, allowing interactive UI and handling events.

By default, components in Next.js are server components, but you can make them client components by using `'use client'` directive.

---

## 🔄 Routing & Special Next.js Files

Next.js uses file-based routing:

- `pages/` directory:
  - `index.js` – The homepage route.
  - `[param].js` – Dynamic routing for parameters.
- **Special Files**:
  - `404.js` – For custom error pages.
  - `app/layout.js` – Layouts for wrapping page components.

---

## 🌐 Data Fetching (SSR, SSG, ISR)

- **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**: Fetches data on each request on the server-side, good for dynamic data.
- **SSG (Static Site Generation)**: Pre-renders pages at build time for faster load times.
- **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)**: Allows updating static pages after the initial build while keeping them cached.

---

## 🖥️ Next.js API Endpoints

You can create API routes directly inside the `pages/api/` directory:

```javascript
// Example of API endpoint
export async function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: "Hello, world!" });
}
```

This allows you to handle backend logic and make API requests without a separate server.

---

## 🔍 SEO & Metadata

Next.js makes it easy to handle SEO and metadata:

- **`Head` component**: Add dynamic meta tags for SEO (e.g., title, description, keywords).
- **Open Graph and Twitter tags**: Use for social media sharing.

Example:

```javascript
import Head from "next/head";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <Head>
      <meta name="description" content="Your awesome website description" />
      <meta property="og:title" content="Your Website Title" />
    </Head>
  );
}
```

Happy coding with Next.js! 🎉
